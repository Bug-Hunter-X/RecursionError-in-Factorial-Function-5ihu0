# RecursionError in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions in Python: the RecursionError. The error occurs when a function calls itself recursively without a proper base case to stop the recursion. 

The `factorial_bug.py` file contains a factorial function that does not handle negative inputs, leading to infinite recursion and the RecursionError. The `factorial_solution.py` file provides a corrected version that handles negative inputs gracefully.
